## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-management-system.git
   cd library-management-system
   ```

2. **Set Up Database**  
   - Create a MySQL database named `library_management`.
   - Use the following schema:

     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE library_management;
     USE library_management;

     CREATE TABLE activity_log (
      id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
      registration_no VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
      name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
      activity VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
      date DATE NOT NULL,
      time TIME NOT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY (id)
     );


     CREATE TABLE books (
      id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
      title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      author VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      publisher VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      year INT NOT NULL,
      available TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 1,
      PRIMARY KEY (id)
     );


     CREATE TABLE issued_books (
      id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
      book_id INT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
      student_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      registration_number VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
      issue_date DATE NOT NULL,
      return_date DATE NOT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY (id)
     );


    
        
     ```

3. **Run the Application**
   - Update the `DatabaseConnection` credentials in `LibraryManagementSystem.java`:
     ```java
     db = new DatabaseConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/library_management", "root", "your_password");
     ```

4. **Compile and Run**
   - Use any Java IDE or compile manually:
     ```bash
     javac LibraryManagementSystem.java
     java LibraryManagementSystem
     ```
